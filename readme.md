# AsyncTerminal
An experimental project to create a simple and lightweight library for asynchronous 
terminal interaction.

## Features
* Built to be used with async IO based programs.
* Supports Linux, Windows, and Mac environments.
* Input is collected as it is typed (doesn't wait for enter press) and it isn't echoed to the
terminal.

## Requirements:
* Python 3.5 or newer
