# AsyncTerminal
An experimental project to create a simple and lightweight library for asynchronous 
terminal interaction and non-blocking input.

## Features
* Built to be used with async IO based programs.
* Supports Linux, Windows, and Mac environments.
* Input is collected as it is typed (doesn't wait for enter press) and it isn't echoed to the
terminal.

## Requirements
* Python 3.5 or newer

## How to run it
Just drop `python3 demo.py` into your terminal of choice.
